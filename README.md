i wrote this with a stylus on a Samsung Tab A7 Lite 
took one hour of predictive writing as a left handed dude (very fun & frustrating , especially the auto space after a word is typed :'(  )  any how, this i'll hopefully make make sure winged is rightfully set here before running winuntil

need to add to $PATH as sometimes winget's path isn't properly Set .  please if you still face errors, go directly download it and install it manually . Also, verify you have [VC ++v14 Desktop framework package](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/cpp/c-runtime-packages-desktop-bridge#how-to-install-and-update-desktop-framework-packages)

thank you & feel free to Reach out for support !! :-)
